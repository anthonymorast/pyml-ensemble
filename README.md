# Python Machine Learning Ensemble
A library/framework used to create and manage adaptable machine learning ensembles in Python.

## Under Construction
The initial version of PyML Ensemble is currently being developed. Feel free to use and contribute to the project but don't expect too much functionality. Additionally, the PyPi package has not been released yet.
